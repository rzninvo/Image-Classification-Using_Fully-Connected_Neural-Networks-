# Image-Classification-Using_Fully-Connected_Neural-Networks-
Implementing a fully connected neural network from scratch and classifying the CIFAR10 dataset.

The main purpose of this project is understanding the importance of Vectorization and how it can drastically decrease the processing time for any neural network architecture.
