# Image-Classification-Using_Fully-Connected_Neural-Networks-

This project involved the implementation of a `fully connected neural network` from the ground up, with the `CIFAR10 dataset` utilized for model training. Key concepts learned throughout the process included `linear regression`, `forward propagation`, `backward propagation`, and `vectorization`. Additionally, an extra assignment involved the implementation of `Convolutional Neural Networks`.  

The main purpose of this project is understanding the importance of Vectorization and how it can drastically decrease the processing time for any neural network architecture.
